# Dark-

Simple dark themes, based on the default _Dark (Visual Studio)_ and _Dark Modern_ themes but with _less_ syntax highlight.

## Rationale

These themes keeps the familiar workbench look of the _Dark (Visual Studio)_, _Dark+_, and _Dark Modern_.

On top of that, these themes dim the whitespace, the ruler, and the line numbers to improve the contrast with the actual code.

The comments color is changed to gray from the default green.

## Themes

### Dark-

The _Dark-_ syntax theme highlights comments, constants, keywords, and strings (basically: the minimum to easily spot mispelled keywords and non terminated strings).

This syntax theme is available in four different workbench theme variations:

- **Dark- (Visual Studio)**, based on the _Dark (Visual Studio)_ theme.

- **Dark- Modern**, based on the _Dark Modern_ default theme.

- **Dark- (Visual Studio) (Flat UI)** and **Dark- Modern (Flat UI)** use a flatter (and hopefully cleaner) look, based on the _Dark (Visual Studio)_ and _Dark Modern_ workbench themes.

### Dark--

The _Dark--_ syntax theme highlights just comments.

This syntax theme is available in the **Dark-- (Visual Studio)** workbench theme variation only.
