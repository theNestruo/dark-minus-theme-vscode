# Dark-

Simple dark themes, based on the default _Dark (Visual Studio)_ theme but with less syntax highlight.

**Dark-** are actually two themes: _Dark-_ and _Dark--_.

These themes keeps the familiar new look of side bar of the _Dark (Visual Studio)_ and _Dark+ (default dark)_.
On top of that, they both dim the whitespace, the ruler and the line numbers to improve the contrast with the actual code.
The comments color is changed to gray from the default green.

The _Dark-_ color theme highlights comments, constants, keywords, and strings (basically: the minimum to easily spot mispelled keywords and non terminated strings).

The _Dark--_ color theme highlights just comments.
